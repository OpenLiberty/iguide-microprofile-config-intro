# Setup

To use the sample application, download and extract the [sampleapp_mpconfig.zip] 
(https://github.com/OpenLiberty/iguide-microprofile-config/raw/prod/finish/sampleapp_mpconfig.zip)
file to your local directory.

Use the `mvn install` Maven command from the directory that contains the extracted .zip files 
to build the project and install it in your local repository. The command creates the 
`displayCarTypes/target/liberty` directory that contains your Liberty server, mpConfigServer, 
and starts the server in the background.

To stop the running server, run the Maven command `mvn liberty:stop-server` in the 
<extract-directory>/displayCarTypes directory. To start the mpConfigServer, run the Maven 
command `mvn liberty:start-server` in the <extract-directory>/displayCarTypes directory.

To access the sample application, visit the http://localhost:9080/car-types URL. Initially, this will 
show all 6 car types, SUV, Crossover, Coupe, Truck, Convertible, and Van since the server.xml has an
appProperties property element for the displayCarTypes web application that has a port value 9085.

The <extract-directory>/displayCarTypes/src directory contains the 
InventoryConfig.java file as shown throughout this guide.  This file is where 
the port configuration property and its value are injected into the code.
The variable has the default value of '9080'. 

# Configuration
You can edit any of the following files to change the port values or 
add the config_ordinal property to override the ordinal value of the configuration source. 
The configuration source with the highest ordinal value takes precedence.
To save the changes on the Liberty server, run the Maven command `mvn package`
from the directory that contains the extracted sampleapp_mpconfig.zip files.

The injected port configuration value is static. Changes to these files only 
take effect at application startup. To restart the application, restart 
the mpConfigServer, as indicated above.

## microprofile-config.properties
This properties file can be found in  
\<extract-directory\>/displayCarTypes/src/main/webapp/META-INF/.
The default port value is 9081. 

## server.env
The server.env file can be found in   
\<extract-directory\>/displayCarTypes/src/main/liberty/config.
The default port value is 9082.  

## bootstrap.properties
The bootstrap.properties file can be found in 
\<extract-directory\>/displayCarTypes/src/main/liberty/config.
The default port value is 9083. 

## server.xml
The server.xml file can be found in
\<extract-directory\>/displayCarTypes/src/main/liberty/config.
It contains a \<variable\> element with a port value of 9084.
It contains an \<appPropeties\> \<property\> element with a port value of 9085.
